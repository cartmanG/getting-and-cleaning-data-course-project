Coursera - Data Science - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

hmmm... this repository contains all the files that were required to do the course project, "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera.

Data was read in from a university project on wearable technology, 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The course project required me to read in data and create a tidy set of data. This involves reading in data, getting meaningful column names, descriptive activity names.

Also part of the course project was the need to output a separate tidy data file with the average of each activity and subject.

#Files
run_Analysis.R - this is the file that contains the script to run the analysis.  It also includes the fifth step to output the second independent data set.

README.md - this file

codebook.md - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

averages_data.txt - the output file from step 5 of course project

#Data Files
